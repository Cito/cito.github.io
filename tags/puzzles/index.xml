      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year my brother&amp;rsquo;s family sent us a puzzle in their Christmas package, mentioning that they already solved it and we should give it a try over the Christmas holidays, too. The puzzle is called &amp;ldquo;36 Cube&amp;rdquo; and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;center half&#34; src=&#34;https://cito.github.io/img/python-36-towers-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;36 Cube&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;36 Cube&amp;rdquo; consists of a board with a 6x6 grid of tower stubs and 36 towers in 6 different heights and colors which need to be stacked on the stubs so that they all have the same height, forming a cube like in the picture. Also, no two towers of the same color may appear in the same row or column - similar to a Sudoku puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzle looked tricky already, but it turned out it was even trickier than I first thought.&lt;/p&gt;
