&lt;p>This blog has been dormant for too long &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s time to post another article. In order to live up to the blog title, this article will combine some old and seasoned stuff (PostgreSQL and Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s works) with the latest trends for agile developers (GraphQL, asyncio and type hints for Python).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web Extensions made with Angular</title><link>https://cito.github.io/blog/web-ext-with-angular/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cito.github.io/blog/web-ext-with-angular/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this blog post I want to show how you can create &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/What_are_WebExtensions">WebExtensions&lt;/a> for modern web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera or Edge using the new &lt;a href="https://angular.io/">Angular framework&lt;/a> (i.e. Angular version 2 and above).&lt;/p>

&lt;img class="center half" src="https://cito.github.io/img/never-iterate-a-changing-dict.jpg" alt="A slippery slope">
&lt;p>It turned out that the program had been running a slippery slope all the time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python and the 36 Towers</title><link>https://cito.github.io/blog/python-36-towers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 17:10:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cito.github.io/blog/python-36-towers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year my brother&amp;rsquo;s family sent us a puzzle in their Christmas package, mentioning that they already solved it and we should give it a try over the Christmas holidays, too. The puzzle is called &amp;ldquo;36 Cube&amp;rdquo; and looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="center half" src="https://cito.github.io/img/python-36-towers-1.jpg" alt="36 Cube">
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;36 Cube&amp;rdquo; consists of a board with a 6x6 grid of tower stubs and 36 towers in 6 different heights and colors which need to be stacked on the stubs so that they all have the same height, forming a cube like in the picture. Also, no two towers of the same color may appear in the same row or column - similar to a Sudoku puzzle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The puzzle looked tricky already, but it turned out it was even trickier than I first thought.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The new f-strings in Python 3.6</title><link>https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/</guid><description>&lt;img class="center half" src="https://cito.github.io/img/f-strings-0.jpg" alt="Benchmark results">
&lt;p>Hurray! It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas time - and Python 3.6 has been released!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html">many goodies&lt;/a> packed into the new release are &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings">formatted string literals&lt;/a>, or simply called &amp;ldquo;f-strings&amp;rdquo;. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why this is good news.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
